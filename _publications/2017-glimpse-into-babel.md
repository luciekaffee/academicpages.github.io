Multilinguality is an important topic for knowledge bases, especially Wikidata, that
was build to serve the multilingual requirements of an international community. Its labels are
the way for humans to interact with the data. In this paper, we explore the state of languages
in Wikidata as of now, especially in regard to its ontology, and the relationship to Wikipedia.
Furthermore, we set the multilinguality of Wikidata in the context of the real world by
comparing it to the distribution of native speakers. We find an existing language
maldistribution, which is less urgent in the ontology, and promising results for future
improvements.
