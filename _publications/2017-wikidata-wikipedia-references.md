Wikidata is a community-driven knowledge graph, strongly linked to Wikipedia.
However, the connection between the two projects has been sporadically explored. We
investigated the relationship between the two projects in terms of the information they
contain by looking at their external references. Our findings show that while only a small
number of sources is directly reused across Wikidata and Wikipedia, references often point
to the same domain. Furthermore, Wikidata appears to use less Anglo-American-centred
sources. These results deserve further in-depth investigation.
