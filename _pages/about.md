Lucie is a PhD student at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, as part of the Web and Internet Research Group. She was a Bloomberg Intern in London UK, a research associate at the TIB Scientific Data Management Research Group in Hanover and was part of the part of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN [WDAqua](http://wdaqua.eu/).

She currently works on the [Scribe project](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Scribe), funded by a Wikimedia Project Grant (2019/2020) and a CredCo Grant (2020).

Her research interests include linked data, mulitlinguality, Wikidata, underserved languages on the web and machine learning, such as naural text generation and machine translation.

She worked as a software developer at Wikimedia Deutschland in the Wikidata team. There, she was already involved in the previously mentioned topics, developing the [ArticlePlaceholder](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Generating_Article_Placeholders_from_Wikidata_for_Wikipedia_-_Increasing_Access_to_Free_and_Open_Knowledge.pdf) [extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ArticlePlaceholder), which displays Wikidata's structured knowledge on Wikipedias of small languages.
