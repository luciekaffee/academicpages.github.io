Lucie is a PhD student at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, as part of the Web and Internet Research Group. Additionally, part of the part of the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie ITN [WDAqua](http://wdaqua.eu/).

Her research interests include Linked Data, Mulitlinguality, Wikidata, Underserved Languages on the Web and most recently Machine Learning.

Therefore, the paper on [Multilingual Data in Wikidata](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/413433/) summarizes her current interests quite well.

Before getting involved with research, she worked as a software developer at Wikimedia Deutschland in the Wikidata team. There, she was already involved in the previously mentioned topics, developing the [ArticlePlaceholder](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Generating_Article_Placeholders_from_Wikidata_for_Wikipedia_-_Increasing_Access_to_Free_and_Open_Knowledge.pdf) [extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ArticlePlaceholder), which includes Wikidata's structured knowledge on Wikipedias of small languages.

She is still involved in Open Source projects, mainly Wikimedia related, where she is currently part of the Code of Conduct Committee for technical spaces.
