In an era where digital spaces are essential to almost every area of our lives, one thing that many of us take for granted is the simple but essential ability to type and read in our own native languages. Yet at this moment and since the very beginning of the boom of the internet for all things work and play, there are millions upon millions of people whose languages are not part of this equation.

Today on the program we explore the landscape of languages that are not easily used or found online, despite their importance for the people who use them everyday and we as a global society who may not notice as we lose pieces of who we are as expressed by the diversity of languages in this world.
