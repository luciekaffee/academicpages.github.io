There is so much you can do with open data! Lucie Kaffee shows three totally different projects she worked on over the last months. Learn about: 
- "Tree Of Life" build with the data of Wikidata 
- "Markets-Berlin Project" based on data from Berlin Open Data 
- "Phones Don's Grow on Trees Project" 
Lucie puts special emphasis on the different possibilities we have with open data, the different sources data can come from and the struggles and advantages is has when we use data from different sources.
