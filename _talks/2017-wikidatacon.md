Wikidata has the ability to serve the needs of many language communities and could change the way computers interact with language online completely - that all depends on the community though.

Therefore, I would like to give an introduction in the state of multilingualism, languages and their interconnectedness in Wikidata to understand where we are now and to draw a plan where we want to go. The main part, however, should be an active discussion on what is needed to add more language labels- do we need different tools? Do we need to include more small language communities? And how can we approach that?

All those questions are things we should discuss in order to understand where we want to continue and how to improve Wikidata.

Recording can be found [here](https://media.ccc.de/v/wikidatacon2017-10043-languages_in_wikidata).

What will attendees take away from this session?

- Understanding of the state of languages in Wikidata
- An idea of the research done in this field
- Ideas for possible improvements
