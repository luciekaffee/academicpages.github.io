On the last Sunday of October 2016 a group of curious and inspired people got together at Wikimedia Deutschland in Berlin for Ladies That FOSS; an open source hack event aimed primarily at women who want to join a free and open source software (FOSS) project but don’t know where to start.  Source Code Berlin was there to listen and observe, a unique experience that we’re excited to share with you in podcast form. So sit back, press play, and listen to  participants talking about what they’re passionate about in the world of software and programming as well as their experience and wishes when it comes to the gender gap in the tech industry.
