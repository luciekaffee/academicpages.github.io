Wikimedia Germany's first Open Source Hack Event aimed primarily at women who want to join a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) project but don’t know where to start.

FOSS programs are those that have licenses that allow users to freely run the program for any purpose, modify the program as they want, and also to freely distribute copies of either the original version or their own modified version.

We love coding but only [11%](http://libresoft.es/research/) of people in FOSS are women or identify as nonbinary, agender or genderfluid.

Why „Ladies“? Because we believe that women are more diverse and tech-savvy than traditional notions would have you believe. So it‘s about time to reclaim the word. "Ladies that FOSS" emphatically welcomes people of all gender identities and aims to give women and gender minorities a special platform to develop their skills.

We believe that this number should be higher. We think that there are plenty of FOSS projects looking for women coders. We also believe that there are plenty of women coders who are looking to get involved and code FOSS.

We are here to help bring those two together.

We match FOSS projects with women interested in FOSS.

###The Event

This is a unique opportunity for nonbinary and woman coders to test out uncharted waters and code FOSS by meeting some people who already got the FOSS flu and are deeply involved in projects.

So this is how it works. This day will be a one-day hack event where women get the chance to dive into the FOSS movement and try out projects. Projects will give women the chance to hack with them on something which can be accomplished on that day. While hacking, the new women on the team can get to know the FOSS movement and see what impact they can have.

This is an event which will offer newcomers the opportunity to engage closely with the projects. Only four to six participants are matched with a project. A unique chance to get to know some of the coolest projects and coders out there and become part of the FOSS community. There will be plenty of time for learning, trying, chatting, eating and most of all, coding FOSS.

We are super excited for the opportunity to play matchmakers for a day and bring women coders and projects together.
