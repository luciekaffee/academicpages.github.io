For the second time, I attended the ESWC conference - this time in Crete. It was great to see known faces again and meet researchers in the field of semantic web. 

Particularly great for me was of course that we published a research paper at the main conference, so I not only got to present the work we had been preparing for quite a while but also had many fascinating discussions afterwards. The general topic of text generation from linked data is something many researchers in the community seemed rather excited about and I could discuss different usecases with them. Furthermore, underserved languages in linked data, how to support them better and how to work with the communities of those languages was a discussion I had multiple times.

I am very glad about the input and the chance of meeting people in the field - something I like about ESWC in particular. Everyone is rather approachable and interested in exchanging ideas and directions for future work.
